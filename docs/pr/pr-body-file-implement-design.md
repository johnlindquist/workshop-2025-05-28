## Summary

This PR implements a complete frontend application based on the mock design in `designs/mock.tsx`. The implementation includes a modern, responsive egghead.io-style learning platform with dark mode support, featuring multiple React components that create a cohesive user experience for browsing developer courses and content.

## Key Changes

- **Component Architecture**: Created 7 modular React components following the design specifications:
  - `WorkshopBanner`: Promotional banner with gradient styling and call-to-action
  - `Header`: Navigation with logo, search, topics dropdown, and dark mode toggle
  - `HeroSection`: Main landing area with hero text and prominent search functionality
  - `BrowseTopics`: Grid layout showcasing popular development topics with hover effects
  - `FeedCard` & `FeedSection`: Content feed displaying articles and lessons with sorting
  - `Pagination`: Navigation controls for paginated content
  - `Footer`: Site links, contact info, and secondary dark mode toggle

- **Dark Mode Implementation**: Full dark/light theme support using:
  - React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for state management
  - Tailwind CSS dark mode classes
  - Dynamic HTML class manipulation for theme persistence
  - Dual toggle controls in header and footer

- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with:
  - Tailwind CSS responsive breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`)
  - Flexible grid layouts that adapt to screen sizes
  - Optimized typography and spacing across devices

- **Testing Infrastructure**: Added comprehensive testing setup:
  - Jest configuration with jsdom environment
  - React Testing Library for component testing
  - File mocking for static assets
  - TypeScript support for tests

- **Project Structure**: Organized codebase with:
  - Component separation in `apps/frontend/app/components/`
  - Mock design reference in `designs/mock.tsx`
  - Detailed task documentation in `docs/tasks/`
  - Testing utilities and configuration

## Testing Done

### Automated Testing Setup
- **Jest Configuration**: Added `jest.config.js` with proper TypeScript and React support
- **Testing Dependencies**: Installed `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `jest-environment-jsdom`
- **File Mocking**: Configured mock handling for static assets via `__mocks__/fileMock.js`

### Manual Verification Steps
1. **Component Rendering**: All components render correctly in the main application layout
2. **Dark Mode Functionality**: 
   - Toggle switches between light and dark themes
   - Theme state persists across component interactions
   - Both header and footer toggles work synchronously
3. **Responsive Behavior**: Layout adapts properly across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
4. **Interactive Elements**: 
   - Search inputs accept user input
   - Navigation links are properly structured
   - Hover effects work on interactive elements
   - Topic grid displays correctly with placeholder images

### Build Verification
- **TypeScript Compilation**: All components compile without type errors
- **Next.js Integration**: Components integrate seamlessly with Next.js app structure
- **Dependency Resolution**: All React and testing dependencies properly installed
